# `createStatus`

Creates a status on a commit or pull request

## Examples

Use a conditional to determine the state:

```yaml
type: createStatus
state:
  left: true
  operator: ===
  right: false
failure:
  description: >-
    Your pull request needs a description in the body. Please edit the pull
    request to include a body.
  target_url: 'https://help.github.com/articles/editing-a-comment/'
success:
  description: Your pull request has a body description.
  target_url: >-
    https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#creating-the-pull-request
```

Specify a context to be able to overwrite the status in a later action:

```yaml
type: createStatus
state: failure
context: my-special-context
```
